<h1>Administration</h1>

<h2>Log Files</h2>

You will need to make sure that the log file is writable by whatever
user (www by default) you have configured the server to run as (in
<code>plexus.conf</code>). <p>

You may want to look at the tools in <code>bin/*</code> for doing log file
maintainence.  <code>bin/summary</code> is designed to be run as
the same user as plexus.  It summarizes the log files using
<code>bin/usage.byhost</code> and <code>bin/usage.byurl</code> into
<code>usage.*</code> files and appends the <code>log</code> to
<code>log.summary</code>.  Then it restarts the server using
<code>bin/plexus-restart</code>.  You may archive <code>log.summary</code>
as often as you like (I compress and save them forever). <p>

<h2>$plexus_top Configuration</h2>

The last thing you need to do is write the files you wish to serve.  This
is probably the hardest part.  Look in
http://www.bsdi.com/server/doc/web-help.html for pointers to information
about HTML and the Web.  This file is organized by the type of user
(user, author, service provider, and developer). <p>

You will probably want to setup an <code>index.html</code> file in
<var>$plexus_top</var> because that is what the server will map the root
to (e.g., accessing http://your.server.edu/ will map to index.html).
Basically, just grab someones that you like and put your information in
it.  For a simple one you might start with something like
http://www.bsdi.com/. <p>
