<h1>Extension Guide</h1>

<i>Plexus</i> was designed with the idea that the server should be easily
extensible by the end user without having to change the internals.  Most
of the major pieces of functionality (e.g., logging, file locking,
authentication, access control, access methods, and configuration files)
are all extensible by simply loading the new functionality from the
configuration file.  The core part of the server is just a dispatcher that
takes the incoming requests and hands it off to the routines you specify
in the configuration file.  The other main pieces are the support routines
for writing your own gateways and a bunch of sample gateways (some serious
and some just for fun). <p>

The following documents are a tutorial on writing gateways for <i>Plexus</i>
and a detailed list of the internal support routines so you can more easily
add your own customizations and extensions.
