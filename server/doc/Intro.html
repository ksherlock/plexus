<h1>Introduction to Plexus</h1>

<i>Plexus</i> is a <a href="Availability.html">public domain</a> HTTP
server written in <a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu:85/info/perl.info,top">perl</a> (you
should use perl 4.0 patchlevel 36 or later).  It is designed to be
easy to install and use, have good performance, and be easily extensible
(serving as a development toolkit). <p>

The core server is about 1400 lines of perl and there are approximately 2200
lines of support routines and 70KBytes of documentation. <p>

<h2>Protocols</h2>

<i>Plexus</i> currently supports both the HTTP/0.9 and <a href="http://www.w3.org:80/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html">
HTTP/1.0</a> protocols.  There are plans for a <i>Gopher</i> protocol
module that will let you serve data from gopher directorys.  The
<i>Plexus</i> dispatch routine can manage incoming connections on
multiple socket ports and manage multiple protocol streams. <p>

<h2>Logging</h2>

There are two logging functions to chose from (and it's easy to write your
own custom routines).  The basic logging routines just log all transactions
to a log file and emails serious errors to the <i>webmaster</i> (this is
configurable).  The alternate set of logging routines use the
<b>syslog()</b> functions to allow remote logging and reporting of serious
errors. <p>

<h2>File Locking</h2>

You can configure <b>POSIX</b> style locking using <code>fcntl()</code>
or <b>BSD</b> style locking using <code>flock()</code>. <p>

<h2>Authentication</h2>

A skeletal <b>RIPEM</b> (Riordan Internet Privacy Enhanced Mail) based
authentication package is provided (<b>RIPEM</b> itself is not included).
Any <b>PEM</b> compliant package would easily drop in to replace
<b>RIPEM</b>.  This requires customization to get working but the basic
functionality is provided.  The most important thing is that the hooks
for providing whatever authentication scheme you need (Basic, PEM, Kerberos)
is in place. <p>

<h2>Access Control</h2>

Hooks for access control (aka authorization) are provided.
The access control module that is provided allows you to pass or
fail the request based on access method, user authentication data
(username, anonymous, or authenticated), host, network or domain name.
<p>

The Access Control system and the Authentication system are
designed to operate together.  The Authentication system
provides the username of the authenticated user to the Access
Control system. <p>

<h2>Access Methods</h2>

You can completely configure the actions taken on each request.
The HTTP GET and HEAD methods are provided and are fairly complete.
There is a skeletal POST method provided (the only provided functionality
is it will mail the request to the server administrator). <p>

<h2>Configuration Files</h2>

There are two levels of configuration files provided.
<code>plexus.conf</code> is the server configuration file that contains
things like the user and group id's to run as.
<code>local.conf</code> is more of a user level configuration
file.  It is used to customize the system and add new gateways. <p>
