<h1>The Directory Browser</h1>

The Directory Browser is in <code>dir.pl</code> and is part of the base
system.  It operates anytime the path specifies a directory that has no
<var>$http_index</var> file.  The Directory Browser is enabled by setting
<var>autoindex</var> to true in <code>local.conf</code>.  If it is not
enabled the user will get an error message when attempting to access a
directory.  <p>

The Directory Browser will print out all the entries in the specified
directory along with the size and last modification time.  Entries that
are directories are marked with a trailing slash ``/''. <p>

You can also use the <i>Search Keyword</i> to specify a <a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu:85/info/perl.info,Regular%20Expressions">
Perl regular expression</a> as a filter to help find files in large
directories.  For example, a <i>Search Keyword</i> of ``gif$'' (the $ is
needed to avoid trying to view the result as a gif file) will filter out
all the files except those ending in ``gif''.  <p>

You can hide files or directories by adding <code>hide</code> lines
in <code>local.conf</code>. <p>
