<h1>Bookmark</h1>

The bookmark feature lets you embed a book icon like:
<img src="/server/bookmark/bookmark.xbm"> and lets the user click on
the forward, backward, or up sections using the image decoding feature.
The menu for what gets returned is embedded in the URL.  For example
the following URL might be for Page 2 of a book:

<pre>
&lt;A HREF="/bookmark/demo_bookmark/index.html:Index_Page/page1.html:Page_1/page3.html:Page_3"&gt;
</pre>

<i>Up</i> would take you back to the index, <i>back</i> to page 1, and
<i>forward</i> to page 3.  The second element of the path (in this example
<code>demo_bookmark</code>) defines where on the server the document is
found; underscores are translated to slashes.  Each element after that is:
the document name, followed by a colon, followed by the text for the menu
that is printed if the browser doesn't support image selection.  In the
menu text underscores are translated to spaces. <p>
