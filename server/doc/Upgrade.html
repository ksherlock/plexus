<h1>Updating: Changes in Plexus 3.0</h1>

<h2>Administrators</h2>

Casual administrators should note that the configuration files have changed.
The most notable change is the most configuration is now done in
<code>local.conf</code>. <p>

<h2>Developers</h2>

Gateway writers should be aware of these changes from 2.2.1 to 3.0 in
the interface to gateway programs (the impact should be minimal on well
written gateways). <p>

The main thing you need to worry about is that incoming path names are no
longer filtered for special characters.  There is a new routine called
<a href="support.html#safeopen"><code>&main;'safeopen</code></a> that can
be used to open files with names derived from user data.  The rest shouldn't
affect code in the gateway itself (unless you want to use the new query
facilities to preprocess the query data). <p>

<ul>
<li> $path is now 8-bit data and gateways using it to derive
     file paths should use <code>&main;'safeopen("package'FH", $file);</code>
     to open files (it works just like <code>open</code> but always opens
     <var>$file</var> for read-only).  Of course, if you open files that
     are defined within your program then there is no danger as always.
<li> Gateway configuration is now done in <code>local.conf</code>
     and has a new (easier to use) syntax.
<li> $_ changed to $path (shouldn't affect the gateway code, just
     the local.conf information).
<li> There are two new support routines for dealing with query data:
     <code>$pstring = &main;'printable($string)</code> converts binary data
     to a printable string for using in the document itself and
     <code>@fields = &main;'splitquery($query);</code> which splits the
     query on ``+'' and converts the %## escapes to data (which means
     that you must be careful using $query data, as always).
</ul>
