<h1>Security Issues</h1>

<i>This file is still under development</i> <p>

<ul>
<li> Running chroot()'ed ``$http_chroot = 0;'' in plexus.conf
<li> ``set relative disabled'' in the local.conf file.
     To prevent access outside the exported tree this option must be
     disabled unless you are running in a chroot()'ed environment.
     Even then I would leave it set just in case you ever decide to
     turn off chroot()'ed
<li> Adding gateways.  See <a href="Upgrade.html">the
     notice</a> about updating from earlier release to 3.X.
</ul>
