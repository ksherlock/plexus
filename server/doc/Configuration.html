<h1>Configuration</h1>

<h2>plexus</h2>

<code>plexus [-c config] [-d topdir] [-i | -I sockfd] [-l log] [-p port]
[-P pidfile] [-D diag]</code> <p>

<pre>
  -p port         Specify port to open (/etc/service name or number)
                  Without -i or -I plexus will start in daemon mode,
                  [-p port] is only useful in this mode.

  -d topdir       Override default directory (/usr/local/www)
  -c config       Override default config file (server/plexus.conf)
  -l log          Override default log file (log)
  -P pidfile      Override default pid output file (plexus.pid)
  -D diag         Specify diagnosic output file (enable debug)

  -i              Use stdin/stdout (e.g., running under inetd)
  -I sockfd       Use specified socket (mostly for server restarts)
</pre>

<code>Plexus</code> contains the main loop that accepts incoming HTTP
connections and forks a process to handle the transaction.  The main server
can continue to accept other connections while the child processes the
request in the background.  The child vectors though the associative array
<code>%method</code>, defined in <code>plexus.conf</code>, to one of the
method routines (e.g., GET is handled by <code>&amp;do_get</code>).  <p>

If started as a normal user, the default port is <var>$http_userport</var>
and is defined in <code>plexus.conf</code>.  It can be changed on the
command line using the <code>-p</code> option.  When started as root, it
will open the standard HTTP port which defaults to
<var>$http_defaultport</var> from <code>plexus.conf</code>.  However, the
port assignment can be overridden either on the command line using the
<code>-p</code> option or in <code>/etc/services</code> by adding a line
for the <b>http</b> protocol e.g.: <code>http   80/tcp</code>.  Command
line options always override internal defaults.  <p>

<var>Topdir</var> defaults to <code>/usr/local/www</code>, the
config file defaults to <code>server/plexus.conf</code>, and the
log file defaults to <code>log</code>.
<p>

<i>Plexus</i> also assumes that perl lives in <code>/usr/bin/perl</code>.
If this is not the case then it's best if you create a symlink for it.
If you can't do that then you will need to edit a bunch of files.  To get
the list run <kbd>find . -type f -print | xargs grep -l /usr/bin/perl</kbd>
from the top level <i>Plexus</i> source directory. <p>

<h2>site.pl</h2>

One of the first things you need to do is configure the site.pl file.
This file contains all the platform-dependant code.  It helps if you have
installed your standard system header files using perl's h2ph.  The only
config option in <code>local.conf</code> that affects this file is
<code>locking</code>, which is set in <code>local.conf</code>.  It should
be set to either <code>flock</code> or <code>fcntl</code>; the default is
<code>flock</code>.  <p>

<h2>plexus.conf</h2>

Next, you should make sure all the settings in <code>plexus.conf</code>
agree with your local system configuration.
There shouldn't be much need to change
this file unless you are adding new features.  The notable exceptions
are <var>$http_chroot</var>, which controls whether or not to
<code>chroot</code> to the top of the tree; <var>$http_user</var> and
<var>$http_group</var> which define the user and group to switch
to if started as root; and <var>$hostname</var>, which should
contain your fully qualified domain name (it defaults to /bin/hostname).  <p>

<h2>local.conf</h2>

Contains settings for various system parameters including: which files to
load, directory mapping, format translations, and
file-extension-to-content-type mappings.  This file is <b>not</b> a perl
script.  It is designed for ease of use and flexibility.  <p>

<h2>Verification</h2>

After you install the files, test the server from the command line
using the following command: <kbd>/usr/local/www/server/plexus -i -l
/dev/tty -D /dev/tty</kbd>.  This will log all information to your tty.
You can type your request directly from the keyboard (e.g., <kbd>GET /
HTTP/1.0</kbd>).  <p>

Finally, run plexus in server mode using the following command:
<kbd>/usr/local/www/server/plexus -D /dev/tty &amp;</kbd>.  Once plexus
is running, test it using your browser.  If you run plexus as root, it
opens port 80; if you are running it as a normal user, it opens port 8001.
