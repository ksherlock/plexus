<h1>Compilation</h1>

The good news is you don't have to compile anything (except perl).  There
are a couple of routines in the <code>tools</code> directory that you may
wish to compile and use but they are not a part of <i>Plexus</i> and are
not required for normal operation. <p>

What you may need to do instead is configure the various paths for your
system.  I assume that you have <code>perl</code> loaded in
<code>/usr/bin/perl</code>.  If you do not, then you need to either
create a symbolic link (e.g., <code>ln -s /usr/local/bin/perl /usr/bin/perl</code>)
or change all the files in the distribution that contain the line
<code>#!/usr/bin/perl</code> (namely <code>src/plexus</code>). <p>

The files in the <code>src</code> directory are the core services files.
Those are the only files you need to run a basic server, everything else
is optional.  <p>
