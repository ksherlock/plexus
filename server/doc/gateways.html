<h1>Adding Gateways</h1>

<b>Principle #1: Simple things should be simple</b> <p>

Gateways are very simple to add to plexus.  In the simplest case, you need
only add a <i>map</i> line in <code>local.conf</code> and make sure your
gateway calls <code><a href="support.html#MIME_header">&amp;main'MIME_header('ok',
'content/type');</a></code> (where <code>content/type</code> is one of the MIME
content types) before doing any output.  <a href="support.html#mime">MIME_header</a> does all the work dealing with
HTTP/1.0 headers. <p>

If your gateway encounters an error it should call <code><a href="support.html#error">&amp;error($status, $msg);</a></code> which will
deal with reporting the error back to the user and exiting.
<code>&amp;error</code> does not return.  Fatal errors can also
be reported with the standard perl <code>die</code> command and
those will be handled by <code>&amp;report_error</code> which will
send email to <i>webmaster</i> by default so you should only
use in cases where something is broken enough that someone should
look at it. <p>

The <a href="/server/apps/fortune.pl">fortune</a> gateway is a good example
to start with because it's very simple.  Note that it is careful
to extract only the information it needs from a user query.  This
is to prevent the users from being able to execute arbitrary commands
on your server.  Any data that comes from the user must be carefully
screened in this way to prevent security holes. <p>

With this in mind I added a few new routines to make creating secure
gateways easier.  <code><a href="support.html#safeopen">&amp;safeopen($FH,
$file);</a></code> will safely open a file for reading and should be
used in all cases where client data is involved.  <code><a href="support.html#splitquery">@fields = &amp;main'splitquery($query);</a></code>
will split a user query into fields and convert any %## escapes it contains.
Most gateways can simply use something like <code>$query = join(" ", &amp;main'splitquery($query));</code>.
Also, there is <code><a href="support.html#printable">$pstring = &amp;main'printable($string);</a></code>
which will convert a string of binary data into something that is printable
using the %## notation for non-printable characters. <p>

<b>Principle #2: Complex things should be possible</b> <p>

There are many <a href="support.html">support routines</a> provided in the
base code for making your life easier.  The <a href="/server/search.pl">search</a> module makes use of several.  First,
it uses <code><a href="support.html#clear_timeout">&amp;main'clear_timeout;</a></code> to
clear the default timeout since it is about to do a search operation that
may take a little longer than normal operations and we are pretty sure
that it isn't going to hang unless there are major system problems.  The
main reason for the timeout is when you are doing I/O on the socket to
the client which might hang and we don't want a bunch of processes hanging
around not doing anything, so always make sure the timer is running when
you do I/O with the client.  You can use <code><a href="support.html#set_timeout">&amp;main'set_timeout</a></code> to restart
the timer if you have stopped it. <p>

<b>Principle #3: A configurable command is a usable command</b> <p>

It's best to make things configurable.  You can use the <i>set</i> command
in <code><a href="/server/local.conf">local.conf</a></code> which sets
the value in the associtive array <var>%plexus</var> so you can extract
values from it.  But it's even better to simply pass the data directly
into your command as arguments to <i>map</i> (this allows the data to be
configurable on a per <i>map</i> basis).  For some examples see
the sample <i>finger</i> and <i>search</i> gateway configurations
in <i><a href="/server/local.conf">local.conf</a></i>. <p>

<b>Principle #4: Thou shall not scrunge others variables</b> <p>

Perl uses dynamic scoping (the value of a variable is inherited down
the call tree).  Unfortunatly, Plexus makes use of this in a couple of
different cases.  The good news is that most servers need only concern
themselves with a small number of variables because they are actually run
in a seperate process from the main server (so each invocation gets a
fresh environment).  Mainly, watch out for <var>$version</var>,
<var>%in_headers</var>, and <var>%out_headers</var> which are all used
in the HTTP/1.0 handling code in <code>&amp;MIME_header</code>.
<var>%in_headers</var> is the list of HTTP/1.0 headers (if any) we got
with the request and <var>%out_headers</var> is used by
<code>&amp;MIME_header</code> to create the outgoing reply, it can be appended
to using <code><a href="support.html#add_header">&amp;add_header(*out_headers, "Sample:
header")</a></code> (which must be called <b>before</b> </code>&amp;MIME_header</code>)
for gateways that need to augment the standard reply headers. <p>

Another side effect of dynamic scoping is that subroutines you call can
modify <b>your</b> variables.  I've tried to carefully <code>local()</code>
all variables in the support routines.  An easy way to avoid conflict is
to run in your own <code>package</code> as do all the sample gateways.  <p>

Users writing new methods must be more careful as they run in the main
server thread and cannot use package to good effect.  You will probably
be ok if you just prepend the method name to all variable names, and be
careful.  <p>
