<h1>Bookmark Demo Page 5</h1>

This demo requires NCSA Mosaic 1.1 or later (or any browser that supports
"&lt;IMG ISMAP&gt;"), you call still see the demo without it but it's not
as cool.  See Also the <a href="/server/walk/walk.html">hypermedia demo</a>.
<p>

You can select the bookmark below to go UP, BACK, or FORWARD.
The "flag" selects UP; BACK and FORWARD are obvious. <p>
