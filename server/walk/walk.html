<h1>SpaceWalk Hypermedia Demo</h1>

<i>NOTE</i>: This demo isn't very interesting without at least NCSA Mosaic 1.1.
<p>

This demo allows you to select different regions of an image and have
different actions take place (i.e., different documents are returned based
on the X,Y coordinates of the mouse selection).  You might also find it
interesting to see what happens when you use a standard browser and
select the image (you get a menu of the things you can select, this
is for backwards compatibility).  <p>

The currently recognized regions are: outer space, earth, astronaut, camera
and the space suit pack. <p>

Hope you enjoyed this demo.  For more information see the <a href="http://www.earth.com/server/doc/decode.html">documentation</a> and
the <a href="http://www.earth.com/server/walk/">source code</a>. <p>
