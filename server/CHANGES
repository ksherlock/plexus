Changes to Plexus from Previous Versions
========================================

Plexus 3.0
----------

* supports multiple servers on the same port using different
  IP Addresses via the [-h host] option (see howto/multiple-servers.txt)
* supports If-Modified-Since and Content-Length
* included cgi.pl
* included inc.pl (for supporting <INC> directives)
* better forms support (including a test mode and an emailer)
* easier configuration (well, you can at least now automatically
  change all the #!/usr/bin/perl lines to whatever you put in
  Makefile.config).  The ``make configure'' step is currently optional.
* lock around plexus.pid (so running plexus twice doesn't mess it up)
* updated documentation
* Added a basic wais.pl module (needs a little work for production use)
* Added basic pass/fail support (access-filter.pl)
* Added basic POST support (currently just emails the data)
* Added generic logger routines (log-simple.pl for file based
  logging with email for severe errors, and log-syslog.pl for
  syslog based logging).
* Fixed security hole in bookmark.pl
* &report_error is now defined in site.pl.  This routine deals with
  reporting internal_error class errors to the sysadmin.  The current
  default implementation just sends email, it should probably
  use syslog but I'm too lazy to do it.
* Log file now contains hostname instead of IP address if possible.
* Added some new security features (&safeopen) so I could remove some of the
  filename restrictions.  $query's are handled by the user now so they are
  more flexible but I added &printable to convert to a printable strings and
  &splitquery which translates %##'s and splits on + (which you can embed
  in the query using %2b).  Things are much cleaner now and as long as
  you are careful with new agents I think more secure.
* Server restart now works first time (you don't have
  to wait for the next request before it restarts).
* Extended &daemon to be able to handle more than one socket so you can
  bind to a list of sockets and &net_filter can have different restrictions
  based on which socket was connected.  This way you can have a local
  domain socket that can handle things like EXEC methods.  Anything in
  local.conf can add sockets to @sockets and it will automatically be
  managed.  Just be careful to keep you FH's unique.
* fixed bug where a timeout wasn't being cleared properly
* Added error handling and reporting routines
* Fixed some documentation bugs
* redid the &net_filter interface, which caused most of the code in
  get.pl to move into plexus so I could filter the request before
  handing it to &net_filter.
* net_filter is not defined by default so it's easy to add your own
  just by adding ``load net-filter.pl'' in local.conf
* moved all the contributed stuff (oraplex and archieplex) into ./contrib/
* added gateways.html which explains some about adding your own gateways
* more/better documentation
* merged plexus,plexus.pl,front.pl into plexus
* added new local.conf file with easier syntax for non-perl folks
* flock/fcntl switch in local.conf
* setext.pl will now run as either a converter or standalone
  it switches automatically (like magic)
* New command line for plexus:
  Usage: plexus [-c config] [-d topdir] [-i] [-l log] [-p port] [-D diag]
* Added diagnostic channel (enabled by -D option)
* moved getuid/getgid before chroot() so you don't *have* to have local files
* You can now run plexus from inetd (or stand-alone from the comamnd line)
  using the -i switch.  Also, if you want to setup the environment
  you can open the socket and chdir/chroot/whatever can call plexus with the
  `-I fd' option, where fd is the socket filedescriptor for plexus to attach
  to.  Mostly -I is used for restarting plexus.
* log file now trys to resolve IPaddr to hostname

Plexus 2.2.1
------------

* Minor bug fixes to 2.2 (mostly integrated archieplex better).

Plexus 2.2
----------

* easier to customize install directories
* removed the crusty account.pl, I think someone is working on patches
  to do this right.
* converted everything to use pacakges
* some security holes patched with .. and invalid requests in get.pl
  Thanks to Mitchell N Charity <mcharity@lcs.mit.edu>
* added support for document translation (lots of changes in dir.pl)
* added setext.pl to convert from setext (.etx) to HTML
* added better image decoding support thanks to Chris McRae
  <mcrae@ckm.ucsf.edu>.  You can now specify image decoding
  in a configuration file ($MAP_CONFIG_FILE) and you can use
  bitmasks or rectangles.  In most cases you don't have to write
  any code!  Things like bookmark are more complicated and still
  require code, but few things really need that.
* &send_file went away and was replaced with: &wrap_file, &wrap_fd,
  &raw_file, &raw_fd.   &require is certainly the only stable
  interface at this point (though I don't see &raw_fd changing again).
  &wrap_* will probably have to change again to make file translations
  work "right".
* added support for hypertext'ed man pages from pre-formatted files.
  In this initial release they are specific to bsdi man pages
  but should be easy to configure for your local system (most of the
  config options are at the top of the bsdi-man.pl file).
* added some log file summerizing scripts

Plexus 2.1
----------

* Mostly bug fixes

Plexus 2.0
----------

* Inital 2.X release
