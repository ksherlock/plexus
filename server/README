This is the README file for the Plexus HTTP server.

This server is provided ``as is'', and without warranty.  However, if you
have a suggestion or comment (bug fixes preferred) please feel free to
send them to sanders@earth.com.  If you write a server module I'll be happy
to look at it for inclusion in the release, just send it along.

Look in the ``unsupported'' directory for some useful tools that you can
integrate without too much effort.  As time allows in the future, I will
move some of these into the standard distribtion.

To install this server there are four basic things you need to do:

 o  Configure src/plexus.conf, src/local.conf and src/site.pl for
    your site.  The default server location ($plexus_top) is
    /usr/local/www and is defined in src/plexus but you can override
    it on the command line (plexus -d /usr/local/www).  The config
    file is server/plexus.conf (relative to $plexus_top) and can be
    overridden on the command line (plexus -c server/plexus.conf).

    Note that items in the site.pl file might need to be changed for
    your site.  I highly recommend that you install the required
    system header files using perl's h2ph.  Plexus will use built-in
    defaults if they don't exist but the defaults might not be right
    for your system (though they should be ok for most systems).

 o  Edit Makefile.config (and the Makefile.run files in each directory).
    You can run ``make configure'' if you want to automatically update
    all the files with configuration data from Makefile.config.  This
    currently only changes the #!/usr/bin/perl to $PERLBIN on the scripts
    but it *does* process every single file and leave the original
    version in filename.bak (so you'll have a lot of .bak files that
    are the same as the orig).

    When you are happy with the configuration run ``make install''.
    You can also install in an alternate directory tree by using
    (this is mostly for testing):
	make install DESTDIR=/altroot

 o  Setup the $plexus_top directory (/usr/local/www by default).
    To start with it's handy to have an index.html file in the root
    directory.  See doc/web-info.html under Authors and Service
    Providers for more information about HTML and setting up servers.

 o  Setup your system so it starts the server at boot time (e.g., add
    `/usr/local/www/server/plexus 2>/dev/null &' to /etc/rc.local).
    If you *really* want to you can also run it from inetd but it
    will be DOG slow.  Don't run Plexus from inetd unless you really
    know what you are doing.  It's *much* *much* better to simply
    run it at startup time and let it deal with opening sockets itself.

To export a directory from outside where the server code lives:
    /private/server/plexus -d /public/www -s /private/server

If you are going to run the finger gateway you'll need to configure
finger.pl.  I don't recommend installing the finger gateway in general
but it's a nice demo for how to do more complex gateways.  The siks, neuro,
npindex, sunman and sunmanindex parts came with the code from cs.indiana.edu
(though I've tried to keep them up with changes I've made I have not tested
them) and will probably need work if you are going to use them.  I'm just
passing them along for informational purposes.  The original code is at
http://cs.indiana.edu/perl-server/intro.html.

If you are going to serve files to the Internet (even if you aren't it's
still a good idea) you should setup a generic hostname (e.g.,
www.company.com).  That way you are free to move the server around without
disrupting the Web.  You should also add a ``webmaster'' alias to point
to the server administrator.  It's also a good idea to put information
about how to contact someone on your home page (an email address is a good
start).

I have tried to make the server run without requiring perl versions of
the system header files (like stat.ph, sockets.ph, etc) but if you have
problems that would be the first place I would look.
