Plexus Version 3.0l (beta)

Available from: ftp://ftp.earth.com/plexus/3.0-beta/prerelease/

New features are:
* supports multiple servers on the same port using different
  IP Addresses via the [-h host] option (see howto/multiple-servers.txt)
* CGI interface
* support for the <INC> directive (in files with a .xhtml extension)
* better forms support (including a test mode and an emailer)
* easier configuration (well, you can at least now automatically
  change all the #!/usr/bin/perl lines to whatever you put in
  Makefile.config).  The ``make configure'' step is currently optional.
* Better error reporting
* Multi-port daemon (can handle requests on multiple ports)
* Loadable access modules
* Easier to configure local.conf file
* flock/fcntl locking switch in local.conf
* Better docs
* Single process
* Standalone or filter setext.pl
* Can bind to a specific IP Address so you can run multiple
  servers on a single machine (see howto/multiple-servers.txt)
* Debug mode (-D outfile),
* New command line args:
  plexus [-c config] [-d topdir] [-i | -I sockfd] [-l log] [-p port] [-D diag]
* plexus will now run from inetd (running from inetd is *highly*
  discouraged, it's far too slow) or from the command line with
  the -i option [these are mostly to make testing & debugging easier]
* The -I option allows you to setup the internet domain socket
  yourself and pass it on to plexus (and this is how restart works).

The major change from 2.X to 3.X that gateway writers need to be aware of
is that $path is 8-bit data, so you must be careful when using information
extracted from it.  You can use &safeopen() (documented in
support.html#safeopen) to open files.  There are also some new functions
for dealing with query data (see gateways.html and search.pl).
